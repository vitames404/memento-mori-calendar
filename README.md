# Life Calendar - Browser Homepage

This project is a **memento mori-inspired browser homepage** built in just one day. It features a **Life Calendar** that visually represents how much of your life you've lived and how much time you potentially have left (based on an average lifespan of 90 years). The goal is to remind you to make the most of your time and not waste it!

2. **Browser Homepage**:
   - Set this page as your browser's homepage to see the Life Calendar every time you open a new tab.
3. **Reflect and Act**:
